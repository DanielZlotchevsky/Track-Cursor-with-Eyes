# Eye Movement Tracking

## About
This program was created and modified to allow the eyes to follow the cursor in the window. This was created with the background image of an owl completed entirely through html and css styling.

## How to Run

This program accepts mouse inputs. Specifically mousemove.

Moving the mouse around withinh the window will cause the pupils to follow the direction of the cursor.
If you hover over the owl, its eyes adopt an 'angry look and maintain this while you hover.
The eyes will blink automatically and periodically, regardless of input.

## Future Roadmap

- Adding more animation the the image
- Implementing mobile support
- potential responsies to certain actions such as typing and respones or clicking on the owl.
